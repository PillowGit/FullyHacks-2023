            In C++, a class is a user-defined data type that combines data members (variables) and member functions (methods) into a single unit. Classes provide a way to create objects, which are instances of the class. By using classes, we can encapsulate data and functionality, making it easier to manage and organize complex code.

        <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
        <div class="plain-text">
          <p class="subtle-fade">
            To define a class, we use the 'class' keyword, followed by the name of the class and a pair of curly braces that enclose the class's data members and member functions. For example:

            <pre><code>class MyClass {
  int myVar;          // data member
  void myFunction();  // member function
};</code></pre>

            Note that the class definition ends with a semicolon. After defining a class, we can create objects of that class type by declaring variables of the class type:

            <pre><code>MyClass obj;</code></pre>
          </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
        <div class="plain-text">
          <p class="subtle-fade">
            Access modifiers determine the visibility of class members (variables and functions). There are three access modifiers in C++:

            <ul class="bullet-points">
              <li> public: Members are accessible from any part of the program. </li>
              <li> private: Members are accessible only within the class. </li>
              <li> protected: Members are accessible within the class and its derived classes. </li>
            </ul>

            By default, all members of a class are private. To specify the access level for members, use the corresponding access modifier followed by a colon:

            <pre><code>class MyClass {
public:
  int myVar;
  void myFunction();

private:
  int myPrivateVar;
};</code></pre>

            In this example, 'myVar' and 'myFunction()' are public, while 'myPrivateVar' is private.
          </p>

        <!-- Paragraph 4 -->
        <div class="plain-text">
          <p class="subtle-fade">
            Constructors and destructors are special member functions of a class that are automatically called when an object is created or destroyed, respectively. 
    
            <ul class="bullet-points">
              <li> Constructor: Initializes the object's data members and can perform other setup tasks. Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type. </li>
              <li> Destructor: Releases any resources allocated by the object and performs other cleanup tasks. Destructors have the same name as the class, preceded by a tilde (~), and do not have a return type. </li>
            </ul>
    
            For example:
    
            <pre><code>class MyClass {
              public:
MyClass() { // constructor
// initialization code
}

~MyClass() { // destructor
// cleanup code
}
};</code></pre>

<!-- Section 5 -->

    <p class="section-title">Inheritance</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Paragraph 5 -->
  <div class="plain-text">
    <p class="subtle-fade">
      Inheritance is a way to create a new class (called a derived class) from an existing class (called a base class). The derived class inherits the data members and member functions of the base class, allowing for code reuse and modularity.

      To inherit from a base class, use the colon (:) and the 'public' keyword, followed by the base class name:

      <pre><code>class DerivedClass : public BaseClass {
        // additional members
};</code></pre> In this example, 'DerivedClass' inherits from 'BaseClass'. Derived classes can also override or extend the functionality of the base class by providing new implementations for inherited member functions.
