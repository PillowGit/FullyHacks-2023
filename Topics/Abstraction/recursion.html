            Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself,
            either directly or indirectly, to solve a problem. The recursive
            function typically solves a smaller or simpler version of the
            problem, eventually reaching a base case where the solution is
            trivial and can be returned without further recursion.
          </p>
          <p class="subtle-fade">
            Recursion can be a powerful and elegant way to solve problems that
            have a naturally recursive structure, such as traversing tree-like
            data structures, solving combinatorial problems, or implementing
            divide-and-conquer algorithms.
          </p>
          <p class="subtle-fade">
            However, recursion can also lead to performance issues, such as
            stack overflow or inefficient use of memory, if not implemented
            correctly. It is essential to ensure that the base case is reachable
            and that the problem size reduces with each recursive call.
          </p>
          <p class="subtle-fade">
            Here's a simple example of a recursive function that calculates the
            factorial of a number:
          </p>
          <pre><code>int factorial(int n) {
  if (n == 0) {
    return 1;
  } else {
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
}</code></pre>
