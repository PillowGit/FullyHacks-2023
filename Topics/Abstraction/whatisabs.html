            Abstraction is a fundamental concept in programming that involves
            simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more
            manageable parts. It allows programmers to hide the implementation
            details and complexity of a system, exposing only the essential
            features and functionality to users and other parts of the code.
          </p>
          <p class="subtle-fade">
            Abstraction helps in managing complexity, promoting code
            reusability, and making it easier to maintain and modify the code.
            It can be achieved in various ways, including the use of functions,
            classes, and interfaces.
          </p>
          <p class="subtle-fade">
            In object-oriented programming, abstraction is often implemented
            through inheritance and polymorphism, which allow the creation of
            abstract classes or interfaces that define a common set of
            properties and methods for related subclasses.
