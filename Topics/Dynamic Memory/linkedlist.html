                A linked list is a linear data structure that stores a sequence
                of elements, called nodes, in which each node stores a value and
                a pointer to the next node in the list. The first node is called
                the head of the list.
              </p>
              <p class="subtle-fade">
                Unlike arrays, linked lists can grow or shrink in size
                dynamically, without the need for expensive operations such as
                resizing or shifting. This makes them more flexible for certain
                applications, such as implementing stacks, queues, or other
                dynamic data structures.

                There are two main types of linked lists: singly linked lists
                and doubly linked lists. In a singly linked list, each node
                stores a value and a pointer to the next node in the list. This
                means you can only traverse the list in one direction, from the
                head to the tail. In a doubly linked list, each node stores a
                value, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous
                node. This allows you to traverse the list in both directions,
                from the head to the tail and from the tail to the head.

              <p class="subtle-fade">
                To create a linked list, you start by creating the head node,
                which contains the first value in the list and a pointer to the
                next node. You can then create additional nodes and add them to
                the list by updating the pointers in the existing nodes. To
                remove a node from the list, you update the pointers in the
                previous and next nodes to bypass the node you want to remove.
              </p>
              <p class="subtle-fade">
                Linked lists can be implemented using classes or structs in C++,
                with each node represented by an object that contains the node's
                value and pointers to the previous and next nodes. Inserting,
                deleting, and traversing the list requires updating these
                pointers accordingly.

                Linked lists offer several benefits over other data structures,
                such as arrays:
              </p>
              <ul class="subtle-fade">
                <li>
                  Dynamic size: Linked lists can grow or shrink in size as
                  needed, without the need for expensive resizing operations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Insertion and deletion: Inserting or deleting an element in a
                  linked list requires updating only a few pointers, whereas in
                  an array it may require shifting many elements.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Flexibility: Linked lists can be used to implement a variety
                  of dynamic data structures, such as stacks, queues, and hash
                  tables.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Memory efficiency: Linked lists can be more memory efficient
                  than arrays, especially for sparse data or large data sets
                  where only a small portion of the elements are used.
