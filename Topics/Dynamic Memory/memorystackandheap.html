      <p class="subtle-fade">
        The heap is a region of memory that stores dynamic data created by the program using the new operator in C++ or the malloc function in C. Unlike the stack, the heap is not limited in size, and data can be allocated and deallocated in any order. The heap is also slower to access than the stack because it requires more complex pointer manipulation to allocate and deallocate memory.
      </p>
      <p class="subtle-fade">
        It is important to note that the heap must be managed manually, which means that the programmer must keep track of which data is allocated and deallocated and ensure that there are no memory leaks or invalid memory accesses. Failure to manage the heap correctly can lead to serious problems such as segmentation faults, memory leaks, and undefined behavior.

      <p class="subtle-fade">
        The stack is used to store temporary data created by functions and local variables. This includes function parameters, return addresses, and local variables. The stack is automatically managed by the program, and data is automatically deallocated when the function returns or the local variable goes out of scope.

        The heap is used to store dynamic data that needs to be allocated and deallocated at runtime. This includes arrays, structures
